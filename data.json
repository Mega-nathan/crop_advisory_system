    "topic": "soil fertility",
    "advice": "Farmers can improve soil fertility by using organic compost, green manure, and crop rotation techniques. Incorporating cover crops and reducing chemical fertilizer usage helps maintain soil health. Regular soil testing is recommended to balance nutrient levels effectively and avoid over-fertilization."

  {
    "topic": "pest control - tomato",
    "advice": "To control pests in tomato crops, farmers can use neem oil sprays, introduce beneficial insects like ladybugs, and practice companion planting. Crop rotation helps prevent pest buildup in the soil. Additionally, removing infected leaves and monitoring the crop regularly can reduce pest damage significantly."
  },
  {
    "topic": "pest control - rice",
    "advice": "For rice crops, using integrated pest management (IPM) strategies is effective. Farmers can release natural predators such as spiders or frogs, apply biopesticides, and avoid excessive use of chemical pesticides. Maintaining proper water levels also reduces the risk of pest infestation."
  },
  {
    "topic": "water management",
    "advice": "Efficient water management is crucial for crop yield. Drip irrigation or alternate wetting and drying methods help conserve water while maintaining soil moisture. Mulching around plants reduces evaporation, and rainwater harvesting can supplement irrigation during dry periods."
  },
  {
    "topic": "fertilizer usage",
    "advice": "Balanced fertilizer application improves crop productivity and reduces environmental impact. Farmers should follow soil test recommendations and apply nutrients based on crop needs. Using slow-release fertilizers and combining them with organic manures enhances nutrient availability over time."
  },
  {
    "topic": "crop rotation",
    "advice": "Rotating crops helps in preventing nutrient depletion and reducing soil-borne diseases. Alternating cereals with legumes can naturally enrich the soil with nitrogen. Crop rotation also breaks the life cycle of pests and improves overall farm biodiversity."
  },
  {
    "topic": "post-harvest management",
    "advice": "Proper post-harvest management reduces losses and improves crop quality. Crops should be dried to the correct moisture content and stored in clean, ventilated facilities. Using moisture-proof containers and regular monitoring for pests and mold ensures longer shelf life."
  },
  {
    "topic": "disease management - tomato",
    "advice": "Tomato crops are prone to fungal diseases like blight and wilt. Farmers should remove infected plants immediately, rotate crops annually, and use disease-resistant varieties. Applying organic fungicides such as copper-based solutions can prevent disease spread."
  },
  {
    "topic": "organic farming tips",
    "advice": "Organic farming focuses on sustainable practices like composting, green manure, and biological pest control. Avoiding chemical fertilizers and pesticides improves soil and water health. Intercropping and using natural predators helps maintain a balanced ecosystem on the farm."
  },
  {
    "topic": "harvesting tips",
    "advice": "Harvest crops at the correct maturity stage to ensure optimal quality and yield. Handle crops gently to minimize mechanical damage, and use clean tools and containers. Sorting and grading harvested produce before storage or sale improves market value."
